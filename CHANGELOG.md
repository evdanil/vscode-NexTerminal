# Changelog

## [2.8.21] — 2026-04-22

### Security

- **Secret macros now stored in SecretStorage**

  Macros flagged `secret: true` previously stored their value in cleartext in `settings.json`. This release moves macro storage to VS Code's `globalState` + `SecretStorage`:
  - **Secret macro text** → `SecretStorage` (encrypted by the OS credential manager).
  - **Macro metadata** (name, keybinding, trigger pattern) → `globalState` (plain JSON on disk, but outside `settings.json`).

- **Automatic migration.** On first launch, Nexus absorbs any `nexus.terminal.macros` entries from every settings.json scope and clears them. No action required.

- **Clean up synced machines.** If you use VS Code Settings Sync or commit `settings.json` to dotfiles, delete any `nexus.terminal.macros` block so the cleartext values there are removed. If they sync back, Nexus will absorb them again on next launch.

- **Threat model.** `SecretStorage` protects the secret `text`. Macro names, keybindings, and trigger patterns remain in plain globalState on disk — do not encode secrets in macro names. Also note: when a macro's text is sent to a terminal that echoes input, it can appear in terminal output and saved transcripts.

- **Backups still work.** Backups and share-exports continue to round-trip across versions. Imports accept both the new format and pre-2.8.21 backups.

- The `nexus.terminal.macros` setting has been removed from the schema — use the Macros view or Macro Editor.
